Problem Description:

-> Consider a fully-developed, incompressible turbulent channel flow.  
-> The mean flow is 1D.  
-> Assume that the flow is statistically stationary (i.e. $\frac{\partial <>}{\partial t} = 0$) and spanwise homogenous (i.e. $\frac{\partial <>}{\partial z} = 0$), where $<>$ represents an ensemble averaged quantity.  
-> Since the flow is fully developed, we have $V = \frac{\partial U}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial k}{\partial x} = 0$.  
-> Thus the governing equations are reduced to:  
$$ 0 = -\frac{1}{\rho} $$

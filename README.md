# FVM Codes

-> Fluid flow and heat transfer problems are solved numerically using Finite Volume Method (FVM).  
-> This repository has problems based on scalar transport via convection/diffusion processes, Lid-Driven Cavity and a general Poiseuille-Couette flow using Finite Volume based Lattice Boltzmann Method and fully developed turbulent channel flow $\left( Re_{\tau} = 395 \right).

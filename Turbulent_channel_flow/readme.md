Problem Description:

-> For this problem, consider a fully-developed, incompressible turbulent channel flow.   
-> The mean flow is one-dimensional (1D).  
-> Assume that the flow is statistically stationary and statistically homogenous in spanwise direction (i.e. $\frac{\partial}{\partial t} = 0$)

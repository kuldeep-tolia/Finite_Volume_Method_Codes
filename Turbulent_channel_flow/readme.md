Problem Description:

-> For this problem, consider a fully-developed, incompressible turbulent channel flow.   
-> The mean flow is one-dimensional (1D).  
-> Assume that the flow is statistically stationary (i.e. $\frac{\partial <>}{\partial t} = 0$) and statistically homogenous in spanwise direction (i.e. $\frac{\partial <>}{\partial z} = 0$), where $<> \equiv$ ensemble-average.

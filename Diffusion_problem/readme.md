Problem Description:  
  
-> For this problem, consider a square domain $\left( x, y \right) \in \left( 0, 1 \right) \times \left( 0, 1 \right)$ with no source terms.  
-> The governing equation for the given problem is given as  

$$ \nabla \cdot \left( \Gamma \nabla \phi \right) = 0 $$.

-> The walls are imposed with the following boundary condition: $\phi = x y$.  
-> FVM is used to discretise the governing equation on a uniform cartesian grid.

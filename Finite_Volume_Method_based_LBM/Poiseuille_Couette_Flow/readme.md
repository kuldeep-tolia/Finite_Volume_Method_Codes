Problem Description:

-> A more general Couette flow includes a constant pressure gradient, $dP/dx$, in a direction parallel to the plates.  
-> The applied pressure gradient can be an adverse pressure gradient or a favourable pressure gradient.  
-> The size of the computational domain, normalized using the plate separation distance $h$, is taken as 2x1 in $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. $x$ denotes the streamwise direction and $y$ denotes the wall-normal direction.  
-> No-slip boundary condition is imposed on the plates whereas the periodic boundary condition is applied on the tranverse boundaries of the domain.  
-> The pressure gradient is treated as a body force term.  
-> The governing Reynolds number is $Re=15$.

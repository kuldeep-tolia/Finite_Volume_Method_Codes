Problem Description:

-> Flow inside a Lid-Driven square cavity is a classical benchmark problem for incompressible viscous flow.  
-> The size of the 2-D square cavity, normalized using the side length of square cavity H, is 1 x 1 in x and y directions, respectively.  
-> All the boundaries are defined as wall boundary conditions where the top boundary translates with constant velocity U and others are stationary.  
-> The Reynolds number can be defined as $Re = U H / \nu$, where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.  
-> Two different Reynolds number ($Re=100$, $Re=400$) are simulated and validated with the benchmark results.

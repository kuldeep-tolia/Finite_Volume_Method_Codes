A Finite Volume Lattice Boltzmann Method (FVLBM) 2D solver based on cell-center structured grids has been developed to study the incompressible and laminar flows. The FVLBM solver has second order spatial accuracy and first order temporal accuracy. The solver was benchmarked against a general Poiseuille-Couette flow and Lid-Driven cavity case for various Reynolds number.  

The solver can be extended to unstructured grid formulations and 3D problems. One can also implement higher order gradient and temporal schemes to improve the solver's accuracy.
